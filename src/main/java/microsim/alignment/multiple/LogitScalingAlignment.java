/**
 * Multinomial alignment methods, where there is in general a set 'A' (>=2) of possible outcomes/states to align.
 * This algorithm is called *Logit Scaling* and is based on the minimization of the information loss (relative entropy).
 * This is an abstract class which can be applied to both weighted and non-weighted cases. Additionally, it can be used
 * in conventional binary alignment problems.
 *
 * @param <T> The Type parameter usually representing the agent class.
 * @implSpec Getters are introduced with the purpose of documenting corresponding variables via {@code lombok}. This
 * way, their meaning is not hidden in commented lines, but accessible with the help of Javadoc. Do *NOT*
 * remove them.
 * @implNote The design of this class suboptimal at the moment to make all class implementations share as much code as
 * possible. In particular, when agents have no weight, they all automatically get one that is equal to 1.
 * This code extends the original algorithm by adding the case of weighted samples. It also does add a filter
 * for the whole population to align only the relevant subpopulation.
 * <p>
 * In the degenerate case when all probabilities are given as open-point distributions this algorithm fails to
 * converge. This happens due to the fact it conserves 0s & 1s, thus, the entire array of probabilities does
 * not change.
 * @see <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/ijm/journl/v9y2016i3p89-102.html">Peter Stephensen, A General Method
