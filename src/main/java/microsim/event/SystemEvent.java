/**
 * System events are directly processed by the simulation engine.
 * There are some special events that engine is able to understand.
 * For instance, you can schedule the end of simulation using a system event.
 * <br><i> SystemEvent e = new SystemEvent(Sim.EVENT_SIMULATION_END);</i><br>
 * eventQueue.schedule(100, e);
 * <i>
 * The above code make the engine stop at 100. When this event happens
 * the simulationEnd() method of the current running models is called.
