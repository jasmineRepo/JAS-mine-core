	 * 	the agent class must implement the Weight interface by providing a getWeight() method.  In the case of the alignment algorithm, getWeight() must return a positive value.
	 * @param filter - filters the agentList so that only the relevant sub-population of agents is sampled
	 * @param closure - AlignmentProbabilityClosure that specifies how to define the (unaligned) probability of the agent and how to implement the result of the aligned probability.
