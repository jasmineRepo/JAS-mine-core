# JAS-mine-core
JAS-mine maintains and develops the JAS simulation platform, an open-source, object-oriented Java-based platform for discrete-event simulations which integrates tools for agent-based and dynamic microsimulation modelling, coherently with a trend of convergence of the two approaches.

It has built-in utilities for communicating with an underlying relational database. In addition, the platform provides standard tools which are frequently used both in agent-based modelling and dynamic microsimulations, like design of experiments (DOE), run-time monitoring and visualization with plots and graphs (GUI), I/O communication, statistical analysis.

JAS-mine favours the separation of data representation and management, which is automatically taken care of by the simulation engine, from the implementation of processes and behavioural algorithms, which should be the primary concern of the modeller. The platform gives the researcher a template on how to structure a generic simulation model.

This repository contains the core libraries, for the gui libraries see https://github.com/jasmineRepo/JAS-mine-gui.
